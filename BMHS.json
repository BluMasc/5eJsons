They have a set of air-holes on their necks that allow them to speak and breathe while their headplates are closed. Drosera prefer to eat meat to the exclusion of anything else, and they train their saplings in the art of the ambush from a young age. As they age, they take on more dangerous game with their sires, passing their skills down to the next generation. Finding work in civilized areas where their cannibalistic nature is not frowned upon is difficult, so drosera who leave their native jungles gravitate toward assassination work that allows them to take the lives (or limbs) of others."

Most nychterid colonies have two locations, and like bats, make an annual migration between the two to stay with favorable weather and the availability of their preferred foods.",
                           "Nychterids are famously private as individuals, except within others of their colony. Most nychterids live in a commune of 2-6 other nychterids. No matter what a nychterid’s other vocation in life, within their communes, they share everything: living quarters, domestic labor, food, sexual partners and child-rearing responsibilities. Nychterids derive their surnames from their commune, which are chosen among its members, and can change when a new member is accepted into it. Nychterid children are given the surname of their birth commune until they join another.",
                           "This desire for relative insulation from others suits most nychterids just fine, as their resemblance to bats inspires a seemingly primal fear in folk, and they are often discriminated against, being thought to be harbingers of plague or disease, or the agents of vampires. This is, of course, ridiculous, and most nychterids maintain a diet of fruit and insects.",
                           "Everyone in nychterid society takes their turn in the kitchen, so most nychterids are gourmands. If a one has invited you to their home and prepared for you a meal, you know you have made a friend for life."

People believe that Malar can't be propitiated and knows no mercy, so he receives prayers only from those engaging in a hunt. Such supplicants pray to Malar for two reasons: to beg the aid of his peerless skill as a hunter, or to adopt his fearsome mantle and thus ward off other predators. Malar is the god of those who delight in the hunt, don't shy from bloodshed, and savor the fear of their prey.",

He has many devotees who are druids and rangers of particularly savage inclination, and many barbarians take Malar as a patron for his ferocity and cruelty. His priests use claw bracers, impressive gauntlets bedecked with stylized claws that jut out from the ends of the fists, as ceremonial weapons.",

            "Most of Sashelas's most devoted followers are sea elves, as are his priests. Many seafarers toss offerings of gold and jewels overboard, beseeching Sashelas to calm storms or provide favorable winds, and he is inclined to aid them even if they aren't fully dedicated to his worship. His sea elf priests often lurk in the water beneath ships when these offerings are made. They catch the treasures as they sink and use them to decorate Sashelas's underwater shrines, to purchase items from coastal merchants that can't be manufactured underwater, and to bribe dragon turtles into their service. Ceremonies honoring Sashelas are held underwater at times of uncommonly high tides or during electrical storms, when flashes of lightning above the waves provide illumination to the calmer realm below the surface.",
